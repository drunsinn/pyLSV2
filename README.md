 This library is an attempt to implement the LSV2 communication protocol used by certain
 CNC controls. It's main goal is to transfer file between the application and the control as well
 as collect information about said files. Over time more and more functions where added which
 support gathering information from the control.

 Most of this library is based on the work of tfischer73 and his Eclipse plugin found at [his GitHub page](https://github.com/tfischer73/Eclipse-Plugin-Heidenhain). Since there is no free documentation beside the plugin, some parts are based purely on reverse engineering and might therefore be not correct.

 As long as no encrypted communication is necessary and you are using Python 3.5 or newer, no additional librarys are necessary.
 
 Please consider the dangers of using this library on a production machine! This library is by no means complete and could damage the control or cause injuries! Everything beyond simple file manipulation is blocked by a lockout parameter. Use at your own risk!

## Usage
 See [lsv2_demo.py](https://github.com/drunsinn/pyLSV2/blob/master/pyLSV2/demos/lsv2_demo.py) for a demonstration of some of the functions.

 Since the whole protocol isn't documented there can always be problems with certain corner cases. Especially during file transfer a lot of stuff can go wrong.
 In case the control doesn't accept a command it returns an error. Some of these errors are checked internally but not everything is covered as of now. It is therefore
 best to check the last error with `con.last_error`. Every error consists of type and a status code. The enum `LSV2StatusCode` contains all known status codes.

### Notes for upgrade to v1.xx
Notice: The change from 0.xx to 1.xx brought some major incompatible changes in regards to the API:
 - raise the minimal required python version to 3.4 (for [IronPython 3.4](https://ironpython.net/)), future releases (1.1.x) will target 3.7 or higher!
 - change of function names and parameters to better reflect their use
 - change of return types from dict to data classes to reduce the dependency on magic strings
These changes where made intentionally to make further development easier. See the demo script for an overview of the new API.

#### exemplary overview of the changes from v0.x to v1.x
| Functionality                | Version 0.x                                           | Version 1.x                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| read nc software version     | `con.get_versions()["NC_Version"]`                    | `con.versions.nc_sw`                                    |
| check if control is a iTNC   | `con.is_itnc()`                                       | `con.version.is_itnc()`                                 |
| get execution status via     | `con.get_execution_status()` returns `int` value      | `con.execution_status()` returns enum `ExecState`       |
| read override values via     | `con.get_override_info()` returns `dict` or `False`   | `con.override_info()` returns `OverrideState` or `None` |
| read axes position via       | `con.get_axes_location()` returns `dict` or `False`   | `con.axes_location()` returns `dict` or `None`          |
| move a file on the control   | `con.move_local_file()`                               | `con.move_file()`                                       |

### Basic example without context manager
```
 import pyLSV2
 con = pyLSV2.LSV2("192.168.56.101")
 con.connect()
 print(con.versions.control)
 con.disconnect()
```

### Basic example with context manager
```
 import pyLSV2
 with pyLSV2.LSV2("192.168.56.101") as con:
 ... con.connect()
 ... print(con.versions.control)
```

### Accessing PLC data
 To read values from the PLC memory you need to know the memory area/type and the memory address. There are two ways to read these values.
 
#### Reading via memory address
 The following command reads 15 marker (bits) starting at address 32. This returns a list with 15 boolean values.

```
 con.read_plc_memory(32, pyLSV2.MemoryType.MARKER, 15)
```
 See [lsv2_demo.py](https://github.com/drunsinn/pyLSV2/blob/master/pyLSV2/demos/lsv2_demo.py) for more examples.

 The available memory areas and their python data type
| Memory Type              | Python Type |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_MARKER      | bool        |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_INPUT       | bool        |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_OUTPUT      | bool        |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_COUNTER     | bool        |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_TIMER       | bool        |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_BYTE        | integer     |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_WORD        | integer     |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_DWORD       | integer     |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_STRING      | str         |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_INPUT_WORD  | integer     |
| PLC_MEM_TYPE_OUTPUT_WORD | integer     |

 Reading the values from the memory address takes the size of each memory type into account.

#### Reading via Data Path
 The following command reads values from the control not via a memory address but via supplying a data access path. This will only work on iTNC controls!
 The advantage is that it also allows you to access tables like the tool table without reading the complete file.

```
 con.read_data_path('/PLC/memory/K/1')
 con.read_data_path('/TABLE/TOOL/T/1/DOC')
```

 See [lsv2_demo.py](https://github.com/drunsinn/pyLSV2/blob/master/pyLSV2/demos/lsv2_demo.py) for more examples.

 Note that reading values from memory does not take into account the actual size in the control memory. This leads to an offset between the values read with `read_data_path` and `read_plc_memory`. As a workaround you have to multiply the address value with the number of bytes the data type requires. The following example tries to show how this can be accomplished:

```
 for mem_address in [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 68, 69, 151, 300, 368]:
    v1 = lsv2.read_plc_memory(mem_address, pyLSV2.MemoryType.DWORD, 1)[0]
    v2 = lsv2.read_data_path("/PLC/memory/D/%d" % (mem_address * 4))
    assert v1 == v2
```

### SSH Tunnel
 Newer controls allow the use of ssh to encrypt the communication via LSV2. 
 See [ssh_tunnel_demo.py](https://github.com/drunsinn/pyLSV2/blob/master/pyLSV2/demos/ssh_tunnel.py) for an example on
 how to use the python library [sshtunnel](https://github.com/pahaz/sshtunnel) to achieve a secure connection.

## Compatibility
 Since there are a lot of different software versions and machine configurations out there 
 it is hard to say if this library is compatible with all of them. Most testing has been done 
 on programming stations but also with real hardware. Here is a list of versions that have
 been tested:

### Programming Stations
| Control     | Software       |
|-------------|----------------|
| TNC640      | 340595 08 SP1  |
| TNC640      | 340595 10 SP2  |
| TNC640      | 340595 11 SP1  |
| TNC640      | 340595 11 SP4  |
| iTNC530     | 606425 04 SP20 |
| iTNC530     | 340494 08 SP2  |
| CNCpilot640 | 1230521 03 SP1 |
| TNC7        | 817625 17      |

### Machines
| Control     | Software       |
|-------------|----------------|
| TNC620      | 817605 04 SP1  |
| TNC640      | 340595 08 SP1  |
| iTNC530     | 340480 14 SP4  |
| iTNC530     | 606420 02 SP14 |
| iTNC530     | 606420 02 SP3  |

 If you have tested it on one of your machines with a different software version, please let us know!

# Tables
 Included in this library is also functionality to work with Tables used by different NC Controls. This includes for example TNC controls as well as Anilam 6000i CNC. As these controls and there software versions use different table formats, it is also possible to dreive the format form an existing table and export the format to a json file.

 See [tab2csv.py](https://github.com/drunsinn/pyLSV2/blob/master/pyLSV2/demos/tab2csv.py) for a demonstration on how to read a table and convert it to a csv file.

 This script can also be used as a command line tool
```
 usage: tab2csv.py [-h] [--decimal_char DECIMAL_CHAR] [-d | -v] source
 
 command line script parsing table files
 
 positional arguments:
   source                table file to parse
 
 options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --decimal_char DECIMAL_CHAR
                         override local decimal char
   -d, --debug           enable log level DEBUG
   -v, --verbose         enable log level INFO
```

# Testing
 To run the test you either need a machine or a programming station. The control has to be on and the 
 PLC program has to be running. The IP address and timeout are set via command line parameters.
```
 pytest --address=192.168.56.103 --timeout=5
```

# Minimum required Python version
 The minimum required python version was checked with [vermin](https://github.com/netromdk/vermin).
```
 vermin --no-parse-comments .
```
 The results indicate that pyLSV2 should work with python 3.5 and even with 3.4 if you install
 the packported modules argparse, enum and typing. While argpares is only used in the demo script
 the other two are necessary. Therefore it should be possible to use pyLSV2 with the current version
 of [IronPython](https://ironpython.net/) if you install these two modules.
