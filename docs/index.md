# pyLSV2
 This library is an attempt to implement the LSV2 communication protocol used by certain CNC controls. It's goal is to transfer file between the application and the control as well as collect information about the control files.
 Most of this library is based on the work of tfischer73 and his Eclipse plugin found at [his GitHub page](https://github.com/tfischer73/Eclipse-Plugin-Heidenhain). Since there is no free  documentation beside the plugin, some parts are based purely on reverse engineering and might therefore be not correct.
 Please consider the dangers of using this library on a production machine! This library is by no means complete and could damage the control or cause injuries! Everything beyond simple file manipulation is blocked by a lockout parameter. Use at your own risk!
